Introduction:
Welcome to NENA, your ultimate recipe sharing app! NENA is a culinary space where you can explore an extensive collection of recipes, share your culinary creations with the world, and connect with friends to discover what delicious dishes they've been cooking up!!

Steps to open up app with a simulator:

1. On terminal, cd into main project folder
2. Type "npx expo start" and hit enter
3. Follow steps if expo is not installed, or if you have no simulator

- Refer to this link if no simulator: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/adding-additional-simulators

4. You can look at the UI either on your computer using the XCode Simulator, or through Expo Go app (scan QR code that shows up on terminal after Step 2)

Our app includes several key features:

1. Create an account by inputting a user id, passowrd, and your cooking levels and dietary restrictions.
2. Look for recipes by typing and clicking on the search icon on the search page.
3. Upload a recipe and instructions through the recipe creation page.
4. Add friends and vire your feed through the friends page and feed page.

Side note: If you upload a recipe or accept friend requests, you can pull down on the screen (just like on Instagram) to view the updated pages for PRofile, Feed, and Friends.
